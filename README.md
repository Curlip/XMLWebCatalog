# XMLWebCatalog

A simple web based Catalog of stuff.

Along the way the project may split into three pieces:

* Master: The main release, contains a mix of updates from the experimental versions: Most Stable.
* Style: Work on SkinIt, and it's default skins, all visual stuff: Still Pretty Stable.
* Features: Work on the core, this is where things get a little weird...: Maybe Stay Clear.
